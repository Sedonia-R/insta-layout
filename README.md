This folder contains the second of three Instagram-like projects for 4Geeks. In this project, we were asked to replicate a photo layout.

To run the project, enter the command:
$ python3 server.py

Note that I imported the server.py file from the codespace on github for this project, so it was not written by me. I wrote the index.html file. I did modify the server.py file by changing the index.html to myinsta.html to ensure that it works.
